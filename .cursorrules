# Project Rules - YourGroceriesUSA

## 1. Identity & Admin Credentials
- **Project Owner:** Mohammad Jebrel (Software Engineering student at HTU).
- **CRITICAL:** Always preserve the Admin access logic. Never modify or delete the following credentials:
  `const isAdmin = user?.email === 'mohammad.dd.my@gmail.com' || user?.phoneNumber === '+962780334074';`
- **Supervisor:** Madonna Samawi.

## 2. Technical Stack & Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router).
- **Database/Auth:** Firebase (Firestore & Auth).
- **Configuration:** Never modify `src/firebase/config.ts`, `.env`, or the project's core provider files without explicit permission.

## 3. UI/UX & Design Language
- **Theme:** 'YourGroceriesUSA' luxury theme (Clean whites, pink/gold accents, and high-quality Arabic typography).
- **Components:** The Sidebar is integrated into `Header.tsx` via a `Sheet` component. Do not create redundant sidebar files.

## 4. Safe Development Protocol
- **Rule of Non-Interference:** Do not modify existing logic in files unrelated to the current task.
- **Consultation:** If a change might affect global navigation or authentication, you MUST propose a plan and wait for Mohammad's approval before editing.
- **Persistence:** Read this file before every task to ensure compliance with the project's standards.
